# MtCarsAnalysis

Data was extracted from the 1974 'Motor Trend' magazine and analysed to explore the relationship between the variables in the data set and the cars' efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG). In particular the the analysis looks at:

Whether an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
Quantifying the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
Exploratory data analysis was conducted, followed by hypothesis testing, which confirmed that manual transimission is better than automatic for MPG. Both single and multivariate linear regression models were then created and the one with the highest adjusted R-squared value used to infer that MPG will increase by 1.81 mpg in cars with manual transmission compared to automatic transmission (adjusted by horse power, number of cylinders and weight).
